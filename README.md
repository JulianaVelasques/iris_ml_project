# :hibiscus: Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my first machine learning project, where I have built a simple classification model to identify different species of Iris flowers. In the future, I plan to add a user interface to allow real-time predictions. This README provides an overview of the project and how to use it.

## Overview

This project is a beginner's exploration of machine learning using the famous Iris dataset. The primary goal is to train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. :hibiscus: :cherry_blossom: :blossom:

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `source/`: Python scripts for training models (`train.py`) and making predictions (`predict.py`) - *Future Enhancement.*
- `data/`: Storage for datasets (e.g., 'iris_dataset.csv').

## Getting Started

To run and experiment with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:<br/>
   git clone https://github.com/JulianaVelasques/iris_ml_project.git <br/>
   cd iris_ml_project
2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already:<br/>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the project's development.<br/>
   Here you can see the steps I made to build this ML project, from loading the data to choosing the best model and making some predictions on my data testing.



## Future Enhancements

As a future enhancement, I plan to add a user interface that allows users to input flower characteristics and get real-time predictions. This will make the model accessible and user-friendly.

*To do that I already created a source folder to separate de logic of training and predicting. With this separation, I'll run train.py to train my model and save it to disk using "joblib".

Separating my machine learning project into train.py and predict.py scripts and saving trained models to disk offers several benefits and opens up various possibilities for more advanced and efficient applications, just like the creation of the UI I mentioned above.

## Feedback and Contributions

I am open to feedback, suggestions, and contributions. If you have ideas for improving this project or want to collaborate, please feel free to reach out. Together, we can make this project better.

Let's Bora!
